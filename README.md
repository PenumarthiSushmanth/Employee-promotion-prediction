# Employee-promotion-prediction

A Machine Learning model is trained to predict the promotion of the employees in a large MNC. In this project, the dataset is analysed and trained with three different classification algorithms. They are:

* KNN
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression

In Evaluation, three scores (Jaccard similarity score, f1 score, and accuracy score) are calculated for each algorithm and chosen the best one.

### About the Dataset

The Data set was taken from Kaggle. A large MNC have 9 broad verticals across the organisation. One of the problem is identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and prepare them in time.

The final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to new roles. Hence, company needs help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.
